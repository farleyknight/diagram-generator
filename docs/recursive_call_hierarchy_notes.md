# Handling Interfaces in Recursive Call Hierarchy

## Problem Statement
In some cases, the outgoing call in the call hierarchy refers to an interface instead of a concrete class. This causes the recursion to stop prematurely because the interface has no further outgoing calls. However, there are scenarios where the interface has only one concrete implementation, and that implementation can be used to continue building the call hierarchy.

## Proposed Solution
To address this issue, we can enhance the `buildHierarchyRecursively` function as follows:

### 1. Identify Concrete Implementations
- Use the `vscode.executeWorkspaceSymbolProvider` command to search for all symbols in the workspace.
- Filter the results to find classes that implement the interface in question.

### 2. Handle Single Implementation
- If the interface has only one concrete implementation, treat it as the next step in the hierarchy.
- Recursively call `buildHierarchyRecursively` for the concrete class.

### 3. Handle Multiple Implementations
- If there are multiple implementations, decide how to handle them:
  - **Option 1**: Include all implementations in the hierarchy.
  - **Option 2**: Allow the user to choose which implementation to follow (e.g., via a UI prompt).

### 4. Fallback for No Implementations
- If no concrete implementations are found, keep the interface as the endpoint in the hierarchy.

### 5. Update the Data Structure
- Add a flag or metadata to indicate whether a node represents an interface or a concrete class.
- Include information about the concrete implementations, if applicable.

### 6. Performance Considerations
- Cache the results of the symbol search to avoid redundant lookups.
- Limit the depth of recursion to prevent performance issues in large projects.

## Next Steps
- Implement the above changes in the `buildHierarchyRecursively` function.
- Test the updated function with projects that heavily use interfaces to ensure correctness and performance.
